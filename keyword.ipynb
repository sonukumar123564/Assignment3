    " a.Valid Characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifiers can include letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscore (_).\n",
    "They must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).\n",
    "Case Sensitivity:\n",
    "\n",
    " b.Python is case-sensitive: \n",
    "    so uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different. For example, myVar and myvar are different identifiers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Spaces and special characters (except underscore) are not allowed in identifiers.\n",
    "Length Limitation:\n",

    "They are used to provide information, explanations, or documentation about\n",
    "the code for developers or anyone reading the code. \n",

    "Incorrect indentation can lead to various issues, and \n",
    "the Python interpreter will raise an IndentationError when it encounters inconsistent or improperly indented code. \n",
    "Here are some common scenarios and what happens when indentation is incorrect:\n",

    "1. IndentationError: Unexpected Indent:\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is an unexpected increase in indentation \n",

    "\n",
    "  If there is a decrease in indentation where it is not expected, \n",
    "         Python raises an IndentationError. \n",

    "Q 6. Differentiate between expression and statement in Python with examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "    In Python, expressions and statements are two fundamental components of the language,\n",
    "    but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Expression:\n",
    "     An expression is a piece of code that produces a value when executed. \n",
    "        It can be as simple as a literal value, a variable, or a more complex combination of operators and functions.\n",
    "        Expressions are often used within statements to compute a value.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    example :\n",
    "        # Literal expression\n",
    "result = 5 + 3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variable expression\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = x * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complex expression\n",
    "z = (x + y) / 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Statement:\n",
    "       A statement is a complete line of code that performs an action. Unlike expressions\n",
    "        statements may not necessarily produce a value. Instead\n",
    "        they often involve control flow, assignments, or declarations. \n",
    "        Statements are executed one after another in a script or program.\n",
    "example:\n",
    "    # Assignment statement\n",
